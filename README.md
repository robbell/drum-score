# Tweeting Machines

*Tweeting Machines* is an interactive, robotic rhythm generator.

Driven by an easy-to-use syntax, it utilises the flexibility of the Twitter platform to trigger custom-designed 
mechanical percussion.

As much an experiment into code-driven music as rhythmical interactivity, *Tweeting Machines* is a sandpit for 
exploring the work of mechanical rhythm generation.

Its operating modes allow for:

- Work for solo Tweet
- Duet for Tweets
- Trio for Tweets and Markov Chain

## Language specification

Details of the score syntax can be found in the [language specification](https://github.com/robbell/drum-score/blob/master/docs/LanguageSpec.md).
