#drum-score (AKA TweetingMachines)

'Tweeting Machines' is an interactive, robotic rhythm generator.

Driven by an easy-to-use syntax, it utilises the flexibility of the Twitter platform to trigger custom-designed 
mechanical percussion.

As much an experiment into code-driven music as rhythmical interactivity, 'Tweeting Machines' is a sandpit for 
exploring the work of mechanical rhythm generation.

Its operating modes will allow for:

- Work for solo Tweet
- Duet for Tweets
- Trio for Tweets and Markov Chain

InMusic'13 attendees are invited to view and control 'Tweeting Machines' by sending Twitter messages from their 
phones, creating an interactive human-computer performance.
